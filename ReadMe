💌 Valentine Proposal Using URL Magic (No Code Needed)

Want to surprise your partner with a personalized Valentine proposal using a simple link?
This project lets you do exactly that ❤️

All you need is a URL and a name.

✨ How It Works

The proposal page reads a name from the URL and automatically personalizes the message.


The page will display:

Hey Her Name, 💖

No login. No backend. Just link magic ✨

🪄 How to Use (URL Hacking 😄)
1️⃣ Basic Usage

Add ?name= at the end of the proposal page URL.

/valentine/proposal?name=HerName


Example:

/valentine/proposal?name=Ananya
/valentine/proposal??name=Priya

2️⃣ Names With Spaces

Replace spaces with %20 or just let the app handle it.

/valentine/proposal??name=My%20Favourite%20Person


Displays as:

Hey My Favourite Person,

3️⃣ Emojis Work Too 😍

Yes, emojis are supported.

/valentine/proposal??name=Cutie%20💖

4️⃣ What If I Don’t Pass a Name?

No worries 😊
If no name is passed, it defaults to:

Hey You,

🏠 Easy Mode (Home Page)

If you don’t want to manually edit URLs:

Open the Home Page

Enter the name

Click Open Proposal

Share the link or hand over the phone 😄

📸 Pro Tip

Record their reaction when they click Yes.
Trust us — it’s worth it 💘

Caption idea:

When your partner works in IT… 💻❤️

⚠️ Friendly Warning

This is meant for fun & love

Don’t use it to prank strangers 😅

Keep names short for best UI

❤️ Final Note

Sometimes, the best proposals aren’t expensive…
They’re thoughtful, creative, and a little nerdy 😌

Happy Valentine’s Day 💕
